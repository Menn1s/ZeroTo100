Note: I've done mainly Linux and Networking so this is going to lack windows and AD material which I'm still learning.
Do one or two sections a day, and you should be more than ready for any project by the end of the summer. Use google and man pages.

# Linux #

### Basic commands ###
These are commands for managing and editing files on a system.
Linux does not usually have a graphical interface, which means no pretty menus.
This basically means everything is done in the commandline.
This makes it faster, less prone to error (clicking the wrong thing), and powerful because you get all of the available options rather than only what is presented on a graphical menu

#### Linux Reference ####
Website: [ExplainShell-Linux commands explained](https://explainshell.com/)  
This is an awesome website to enter commands and see what their options do.
Ex: If you don't know what "df -h" does, type it in!

### Linux Security ###
Bandit is a set of challenges on OverTheWire and it teaches basics of linux security

Connect via putty or ssh. (Google them if you don't know what either of those are)

### More Advanced Security
Vulnhub has virtual machines that are made to be hackable. 
Most of us would not know how to even start, so find a virtual machine with a walkthrough and follow along command by command. Easier yet, search the name of the VM on youtube and watch somebody hack it.

* hint: Install a Kali virtual machine as well to attack the vulnhub VM

# Networking #
### How networks are built ###

### How Things Connect ###  
Video: [TCP Ports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mykX2YONRwE)  
We will work with actual configs and systems at trainings
### How Public Keys Work ###
These allow for a massive chunk of internet security, and why services like tor are extremely difficult even for a government entity to crack.

### Packet Tracer Practice (configuring networks) ###
Lookup how to download NetAcad's packet tracer.

I hightlighted the most helpful starting ones in green; they come with solution PDFs
